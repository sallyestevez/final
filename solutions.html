      <h3>1. Unsubscribe from Prime</h3>
      <p>You get to save $120 per year :). Plus, you don't need two day shipping for EVERYTHING.</p>

      <h3>Shop local</h3>
      <p>Need books? Go to your local bookstore.</p>

      <h3>Do your online shopping somewhere else</h3>
      <p>There are so many online stores where you can do your shopping.</h3>

      <h3>Stop shopping at Whole Foods</h3>
      <p>Just go to Food Bazaar. They're cheaper.</p>

      <h3>Stop using Amazon Prime Music and Amazon Music Unlimited</h3>
      <p>I've literally never heard of anyone using those services anyway.</p>

      <h3>Get rid of your Amazon Echo</h3>
      <p>Alexa is always listening. Isn't that creepy?</p>

      <h3>Piracy</h3>
      <p>Sad you can't watch that one Prime Video exclusive show anymore? Try to look for it somewhere else. *HINT HINT*</p>
